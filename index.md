# A-Chiez Pin’in

**A-Chiez Pin’in** (阿傑拼音), is a romanization system for Standard Mandarin Chinese. The system is based on Taiwanese Mandarin but it is also suitable for most other Standard Mandarin varieties. It was created by Joe Chrongx, a nobody on the internet. The main goal is to make romanization for Taiwanese Mandarin more phonetic.

## Initials

There are 18 initials in total. They are marked with the equivalent Bopomofo and Pinyin below:

| A-Chiez Pin’in | Bopomofo | Pinyin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p | ㄅ | b |
| ph | ㄆ | p |
| m | ㄇ | m |
| f | ㄈ | f |
| t | ㄉ | d |
| th | ㄊ | t |
| n | ㄋ | n |

| ch | ㄐ, ㄗ [1] | j, z [1] |
| chh | ㄑ, ㄘ [1] | q, c [1] |
| s | ㄒ, ㄙ [1] | x, s [1] |
| chr | ㄓ | zh |
| chhr | ㄔ | ch |
| sr | ㄕ | sh |

## Finals

The finals include 3 medials, 8 vowels and 3 endings. Unlike Pinyin, You can start with i, u, and y without the need of w and y as initials, which is similar to Bopomofo. They are marked with the equivalent Bopomofo and Pinyin below:

|  | ø | a | oo | o | e | ai | ei | au | oou | -n | an | on | en | -ng | ang | oong | ong |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ø |  | a (ㄚ a) | oo (ㄛ o) | o (ㄜ e) | e (ㄝ ê) | ai (ㄞ ai) | ei (ㄟ ei) | au (ㄠ ao) | oou (ㄡ ou) |  | an (ㄢ an) | en (ㄣ en) |  |  | ang (ㄤ ang) | oong (ㄨㄥ ong) | ong (ㄥ ong) |
| i | i (ㄧ i) | ia (ㄧㄚ ia) |  |  | ie (ㄧㄝ ie) |  |  | iau (ㄧㄠ iao) | ioou (ㄧㄡ iu) | in (ㄧㄣ in) |  |  | ien (ㄧㄢ ian) | ing (ㄧㄥ ing) | iang (ㄧㄤ iang) | iong (ㄩㄥ iong) |  |
| u | u (ㄨ u) | ua (ㄨㄚ ua) | uoo (ㄨㄛ uo) |  |  | uai (ㄨㄞ uai) | uei (ㄨㄟ ui) |  |  |  | uan (ㄨㄢ uan) | uen (ㄨㄣ uen) |  |  | uang (ㄨㄤ uang) | [2] |  |
| y | y (ㄩ ü) |  |  |  | ye (ㄩㄝ üe) |  |  |  |  | yn (ㄩㄣ ün) | yan (ㄩㄢ üan) |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Tone marking

There are two ways to mark tones in A-Chiez Pin’in: **diacritics** and **endings**.

### With diacritics

Like Bopomofo, first tone is not marked. Here are the ways to write the tones:

|  | Flat tone | Rising tone | Falling-Rising tone | Falling tone | Neutral tone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| With chr/chhr/sr/r | chr  | chŕ | chř | chȑ [3] | chṛ |
| WIth ch/chh | ch | ćh | čh | çh [3] | ċh [4] |
| With s | s | ś | š | ş [3]  | ṣ  |
| With i/u/y | chie | chíe | chǐe | chìe | chịe |
| Other case | ma | má | mǎ | mà | mạ |

### With endings

Like Bopomofo, first tone is not marked. Here are the ways to write the tones:

| Flat tone | Rising tone | Falling-Rising tone | Falling tone | Neutral tone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ma | maz | mav | max | mam |

## Extra rules

When two finals of different words are connected, they need to be separated with ‘ or capitalize the first letter of the second word. For example:

Chia 嘉 + Ix 義 = Chia’ix or ChiaIx (嘉義)

[1] *When ch, chh or s are connected with i- or y-, they are pronounced as ㄐㄑㄒ j q x. Else, it is pronounced as ㄗㄘㄙ z c s.*

[2] *Although u + oong exists (ㄨㄥ weng), it is pronounced as oong (ㄨㄥ ong) by most Taiwanese, so it doesn’t exist.*

[3] *They are supposed to be written with a grave accent, but I am not able to find the version for those.*

[4] *They are supposed to be written with a dot under, but I am not able to find the version for that.*
